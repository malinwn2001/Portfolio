        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am Malin, a person passionate about things like Video Editing, Graphic Design,
        </p>

        <h2>About <span>me</span></h2>
        <p>
            I hold a Bachelor`s degree in Digital Media and Design from Høgskolen i Østfold, 
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            on the world of exciting possibilites in IT and Design. My biggest passion is Video Editing, 
        </p>
        <p>
            for the past 8 years now doing it in my spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also found a new interest through my studies, which is Graphic Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those are some of the things I hope to work with and expand on in a future career.
        </p>

        <h2>Passion and <span>Values</span></h2>
        <p>
            What fuels my creativity is the belief that design is not just about aesthetics but about telling a story. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm dedicated to creating designs that not only look good but also convey a narrative that resonates with the audience.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Personal <span>Interests</span></h2>
        <p>
            In the dynamic realm of creativity, two passions have been my guiding lights: video editing and video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the past eight years, video editing has been my chosen avenue for unrestricted self-expression.
        </p> 
        <p>
            It's not just about splicing clips; it's about pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling 
        </p>
        <p>
            and exploring the far reaches of my imagination. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the earliest tentative edits to the seamless compositions of today, each project has become a canvas for my artistic evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the pixels and timelines, I find solace in the captivating world of video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's my sanctuary — a place where I can momentarily silence the analytical side of my brain and immerse myself in
        </p>
        <p>
            the narratives and interactive experiences that only games can offer. Whether embarking on epic quests or discovering hidden 
            gems in the indie gaming scene, 
            each game presents a new adventure waiting to be explored.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This dual passion for video editing and gaming brings a unique balance to my life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Video editing allows me to shape narratives and craft visual stories, 
            while gaming permits me to be a participant in stories crafted by others. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, they create a harmonious blend of creation and consumption in my creative universe.
